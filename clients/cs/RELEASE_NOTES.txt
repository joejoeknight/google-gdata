== 1.0.6 == 
- Added support for sortoder, futurevents, singleevents on the calendarquery
- Added a ResponseString property on the GDataRequestException to make debugging server side errors easier
- Fixed an issue with the GoogleBaseService, if you did set the RequestFactory property twice, you would 
  create too many header entries, and hence end up with request denied responses
- Added the shipping attribute for GoogleBase
- Changed the payment attribute to payment_accepted for GoogleBase

== 1.0.5 ==
- Added batch support for GoogleFeeds, the first property to support this is the GoogleBase product
- Added a unittest for GoogleBase. This code shows update/insert/delete against base for single entries and batch entries
  refer to clients/cs/src/unittests/gbase.cs for sample code. 
- Added IComparable to atomuri.cs (based on a feature request on our issue list)
- GDataAuthRequestFactory is now a subclass of GDataRequestFactory
- Moved GCookies from GDataAuthRequestFactory to GDataRequestFactory and renamed it to Cookies
- removed the debug binaries from the lib directory
- added a GoogleBase sample application in VB ! 
- added the build executables to the lib directory
- added GoogleBase classes (similiar to the java classes) to access Google base specific feeds

Known issues:
- recurrenceException is not fully tested
- authsubutil and gauthsubrequest are not fully tested


== 1.0.4 == 
- Fixed a .NET 2.0 issue in calendarservice.cs, that dropped connections during repeated calls. 
- Made the execution path more robust. 
- Added a property, numberOfRetries on the GAuthRequestFactory to indicate how often an Execution should be retried if the server returns an error. 
- Fixed a bug in the daterange query creation (the +sign for the timezone was not escaped properly)
- Fixed an issue with updating, where if you used the same AtomEntry/EventEntry several times to update, it could happen that extension 
  elements were doubled, and the update failed.
- Fixed a bug in the parsing of all elements. This could cause an endless loop when the content was empty.
- Fixed several content creation issues (issues 5-9 on the issue list)
- added support for the gd:extendedProperty
- Added a calendar example application
- added a sample application to access Blogger feeds, and post to blogger feeds. 

Known issues:
- recurrenceException is not fully tested
- authsubutil and gauthsubrequest are not fully tested
Solved issues:
 - .NET 2.0 seems to loose resources in some circumstances. Hard to reproduce.



== 1.0.3 ==
- Fixed the namespace creation for extensions, the wireformat should no longer create the namespace declaration when it's not required
- Fixed the reminder persistence code
- added a TimeZone property on the EventFeed to retrieve the timezone value 
- added a FindEvent method on the EventFeed. This one takes an OriginalEvent object, and returns the 
  Event that this is based on. This will go to the server if required. 
- Fixed recurrance issues in the extensions 
- Moved EventFeed and EventEntry from the Google.GData.Extensions namespace to the Google.GData.Calendar namespace
- Fixed a bug in the parsing of Atom:Content elements. This could cause an endless loop when the content was empty.

== 1.0.2 ==
- Fixed a problem persisting feedlink elements
- added an AllDay flag to the When class to allow parsing and persting of all day events
- cleaned up the persistence code in the extension classes
- fixed a problem that resulted in persisting multiple extensionn objects instead of one
- added a timestamp method to the Tracing class to help measuring performance in simple cases

== 1.0.1 ==
- Correctly uses 'rel.previous' instead of 'rel.prev' as required by Atom
  Publishing Protocol.
- Corrected the time-shift portion of the DateTime output for time zones with a
  negative shift from UTC.
- Corrected the time-shift to permit fractional hour shifts from UTC.
- Correctly output "startTime" and "endTime" as attributes of the "when"
  extension rather than child elements.
- Refactored class hierarchy, now based on IExtensionElement. 

== 1.0.0 ==
- Initial Release
