<title>Releasse Notes</title>
    
<h1>This document lists the changes in the different releases</h1>


<h2>1.1.0.0</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        To enable ASP.NET hosting in medium trust, we removed the usage of the 
        NetworkCredentials class. From now on, credentials are either passed as username/password, 
        or using the GDataCredentials. (issue 57)
    </li>
    <li>
        Changed "adminUserName" to "adminEmailAddress" in AppsService so that it's more 
        clear what information is actually required for this parameter.
    </li>

    <li>
        added GZip support for .NET 1.1, 2.0 and .NET Compact Framework 2.0.
    </li>
    <li>
        fixed a Google Base issue (The server doesn't accept scientific notations for 
        floats)
    </li>
    <li>
        fixed typo in the blogger sample (www..blogger), which made the sample hard to 
        use
    </li>
    <li>
        added the ability to use authsubtokens to the ExecRequest utility (including 
        exchange of a onetime token to a session token). Just run ExecRequest for the 
        command line parameters
    </li>

    <li>
        make the GAuthToken property of the GAuthRequestFactory public. It was 
        mistakenly marked internal, so that the token could not be retrieved by a client 
        application for caching.  
    </li>
    <li>
        fixed a parsing issue that resulted in Batch Upload hanging if an unknown 
        element was encountered
    </li>
    <li>
        added a helper method on AtomBase (entry and feed) to find exensionelements by 
        specifying a localname and an optional namespace (issue 81)
    </li>
    <li>
        the extension mechanism was reworked by creating an ExtensionElementFactory 
        interface that takes care of parsing elements. ElementFactories are registered 
        on the AtomBase (entry and feed) level.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed Issue 60, mulitple Reminders per Event. Note, that this introduces slight 
        changes when dealing with this. A new property, EventEntry.Reminders, was 
        created. The old property, EventEntry.Reminder, still exists, and only works on 
        the first Reminder in the list. Setting the old property will delete all 
        addtional reminders.The Reminders property is of type ArrayList (this is an 
        artifact of being .NET 1.1 compatible, once we move to .NET 2.0 or later, if 
        that ever happens, this could/should be typed).
    </li>
    <li>
        Support for Google Calendar WebContent Gadgets is included. A WebContent element 
        has a SortedList property to set and retrieve those preferences. See caltest.cs 
        for an example.
    </li>
    <li>
        Modified data model for Spreadsheets worksheets to make it easier to change and 
        construct associated meta-data
    </li>
    <li>
        Added the ctz parameter to the EventQuery class. This parameter allows to 
        specify the timezone that is used to calculate start/end times for the returned 
        events
    </li>
    <li>
        Added an AlternateUri Property on the AtomEntry class. This property 
        returns the AtomUri of a rel=alternate type=html LINK entry. As this is 
        similiar to the ill named LINK helper on the spreadsheet entry, that 
        helper was removed, as they do serve the same purpose, and the link 
        helper was read only.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added an FeedUri Property on the AtomEntry class. This property 
        returns the AtomUri of a rel=#feed type=atom+xml LINK entry.
    </li>
     <li>
        Added an MediaUri Property on the AtomEntry class. This property 
        returns the AtomUri of a rel=#edit-media type=atom+xml LINK entry.
    </li>
    <li>
        Preliminary Picasa support:
        <ul>
            <li>Added all media extensions (media:rss, exif and photo></li>
            <li>Added a PhotoEntry and PhotoFeed class that contain all of 
                those extensions</li>
            <li>Added unittests to query an album and insert a new photo</li>
        </ul>
    </li>


</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.9</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        added GBase support for m:adjusted_name and gm:adjusted_value inside attributes 
        (returned only when adjustments are enabled)
    <li>
        Google Apps changes:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Added new AppsService.createUser methods with hashed password support
            <li>
                Updated AppsException with new Google Apps error codes
            <li>
                Added the following properties to Login.cs: string hashFunctionName 
            <li>
                to hash user account password, bool agreedToTerms 
            <li>
                to see if the user has accepted the Google Apps Terms Of Service, bool admin 
            <li>
                to see if the user is a domain admin, bool changePasswordAtNextLogin 
            <li>
                to force the user to change password at next login
            <li>
                Updated unittests to test new properties
        </ul>
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.8</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        fixed a parsing bug in SpreadsheetService
    <li>
        fixed a bug in GDataRequestException that would prevent AppsException from 
        accessing the server's response.
    <li>
        modified AppsException to comply with new GDataRequestException
    <li>
        fixed a bug in CalculateBaseUri, that caused a crash if the passed in parameters 
        are all NULL. This caused composite feeds to not load if there was a comment 
        feed embedded
    <li>
        fixed a bug in the CalendarEventEntry, it was not parsing extendedProperties. 
        They are now parsed and added correctly to the ExtensionElements
    <li>
        added ACL support. This resulted in changes in the CalendarService.Query method 
    <li>
        as a CalendarService can now return an EventFeed or an AccessControlFeed is 
        returns now an AtomFeed that you can cast to what you are expecting. Added Query 
        overloads to accept EventQuery or AclQuery and return the appropriate Feeds
    <li>
        added a cmd line tool to query/insert/update to a service based on streams
    <li>
        modified the Spreadsheet service to use the new scheme of service subclassing. 
        This should fix a bundle of issues with regard to entry castings.
    <li>
        changed persistence of gd:extendedProperty to save the value attribute, even if 
        there is no data to persist
    <li>
        Added an ASP.NET release (lib/ASP.NET) where the DLLs are build with the 
        AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers attribute n enabled. Please use with caution and 
        refer to the readme.txt in that subdirectory for more information.
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.7</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        fixed an incorrect trace statement in request.cs that had the result of 
        disabling reading the error response.
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.6</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        added Google Apps for Your Domain support, a new helper DLL Google.GData.Apps.dll, 
        and a sample, as well as unittests. Version number is increased to distinguish 
        from Subversion, as this will be a binary download as well.
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.5</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        fix for incorrect encoding of usernames/passwords during authentication (you 
        could run into problems if you had an email like "foo&joe@test.com"
    <li>
        exposure of the accountType as a property on the factory. If you happen to have 
        an identical user name for a Google account and a hosted account, you need to 
        set this property depending on which account you want to access. Default is 
        GOOGLE_OR_HOSTED, other values are GOOGLE or HOSTED as strings.
    <li>
        fixed an issue with the edit/self uris on the entry. They were not correctly 
        setable.
    <li>
        fixed an issue that one you used an authenticated service, but did not supply 
        credentials, we would send an empty authentication header.
    <li>
        added Captcha Handling and more detailed exceptions when the authentication 
        request fails. See authexceptions.cs for the list of potential exceptions thrown
    <li>
        added some preliminary unittests for the new exceptions
    <li>
        added a new constructor for the TokenCollection, so that captcha parsing is 
        handled correctly
    <li>
        made the debug output depending on the TRACE define, and removed that define for 
        the release build
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.4</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Google Base: fix for incorrect Price attribute behaviour
    <li>
        Google Base: fix for incorrectly persisting duplicate attributes
    <li>
        Fix for Content.Type having no default value (issue 41)
    <li>
        Fix for Content.Type="text/html" parsing incorrectly. The strict check for type=
        "text" is now relaxed to be type="text*", so all text subtypes will be treated 
        the same
    <li>
        Fix for Content.Type = "html" and "text/html" persistence. What the code does 
        now is: first HTMLDecode the value held, than run the standard XMLWriter.WriteString 
        over it (which does HTML encoding). This seems to work fine.
    <li>
        Added the gm:stats tags to the Windows Mobile build, accidently forgot to change 
        that project file
    <li>
        the calendarfeed discarded entries unknown to it in the calendar namespace. This 
        is fixed now. Unknown entries to the parser are now correctly added to the 
        extension elements.
    <li>
        added the return-empty parameter to the cellquery class
    <li>
        added URL encoding to the authentication parameters (username/passwords etc that 
        had unallowed FORM post chars caused failed login attempts)
</ul>



<h2>1.0.9.3</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Google Base changes: New features:
        <ul>
            <li>
                GBaseQuery supports the following optional parameters; orderby, sortorder, 
                refine and content
            <li>
                Support for gm:stats tags
            <li>
                GBaseUriFactory can now generate the feed uri of other customers
                Fixes:
            <li>
                Fixed the GBaseAttributeType hierarchy for date/dateTime/dateTimeRange
            <li>
                Fixed the type of the hardcoded ExpirationDate property in GBaseAttributes
        </ul>
    <li>
        Added a Makefile for Mono builds. This one replaces the Ant file.
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.2</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Removed the MethodOverride default for the CalendarService. If you need that (due 
        to firewalls not allowing PUT/DELETE requests, you can reenable this with 
        setting the MethodOverride flag on the factory: ((GDataGAuthRequestFactory)calsvc.RequestFactory).MethodOverride 
        = false;
    <li>
        Changed the X-Method-Override behaviour for DELETE, to fix an issue with .NET 
        mobile (the mobile client would crash when the contentLength was set to 0 and no 
        stream was requested).
</ul>

<h2>1.0.9.1</h2>
<li>
    Added a KeepAlive property to the factory object. This is set to true by default. 
    .NET 2.0 clients, are due to behaviour changes in that runtime encouraged to set 
    this to false.

    <h2>1.0.9</h2>
<li>
    Fixed an issue where the login services changed the response contenttype. The 
    check for text/plain is now more relaxed.
<li>
    Added the missing location calls for Geolocation for GoogleBase
<li>
    Fixed a build issue for Windows Mobile in release. The code now compiles for 
    PocketPC and WindowsMobile symbols defined.
    <h2>1.0.8</h2>
<li>
    Fixed issue 13 from the public issue list. If a content element contained xhtml, 
    and not just text, the content was not read correctly.
<li>
    Fixed issue 17 from the public issue list. XHTML content was not persisted 
    correctly.
<li>
    Added support for hosted domain feeds. This is done automatically, no 
    codechanges needed for the application developer. The authentication code was 
    changed to ask for Hosted domains first, then google accounts.
<li>
    Added support for the app:control/app:draft element, but only in the way to 
    expose a boolean on the AtomEntry. The new member on AtomEntry is called IsDraft.
<li>
    Changed the way atom:content is parsed. Text & HTML types use xmlreader.ReadString() 
    to get the inner content. XHTML and all other types use readInnerXml() to get 
    the content.
<li>
    changed Exception handling. The code now throws more detailed exceptions based 
    on what was happening: -> GDataRequestException: generic exception -> 
    GDataForbiddenException: exception thrown when the server return a Forbidden on 
    authentication -> GDataRedirectException: exception thrown when the server 
    returned a redirect
<li>
    changed redirect handling on Post. The library will follow redirects on Post 
    automatically by default, to accomodate Blogger (which currently may return 302s 
    on posts). This can be turned off by setting the .StrictRedirect property to 
    true on the GDataAuthRequestFactory. If it is turned off, the code will throw if 
    a redirect is happening on an HTTP verb other than GET.
<li>
    changed redirect handling for DELETE/PUT the same as for POST
<li>
    removed cookie handling. The code will handle cookies now without using the 
    CookieContainer (one hurdle on the way to the CompactFramework Port).
<li>
    Fixed persistence of "initialized" date values for udpated/published on the atom.entry. 
    This resolves an issue with the Blogger.
<li>
    Added EventEntry.Notifications. This property (boolean) indicates if an update 
    on an entry should send notifications to the attendees of the Event.
<li>
    Fixed the gbase project (the NumberFormat.cs file was missing in the project 
    file).
<li>
    Added a proxy property for the GDataRequestFactory.
<li>
    Setting content-length correctly to fix WindowsMobile issues. This fix is a user 
    submitted, and created by Steeve Morin
<li>
    Fixes to the authsub code, provided by Ryan Boyd
<li>
    The DLLs were renamed, to follow the Windows .NET standard. gdata.dll       ->      
    Google.GData.Client.dll gbase.dll       ->      Google.GData.GoogleBase.dll 
    gcalendar.dll   ->      Google.GData.Calendar.dll gcodesearch.dll ->      Google.GData.CodeSearch.dll 
    gextensions.dll ->      Google.GData.Extensions.dll and the new one ->      
    Google.GData.Spreadsheets.dll


    <h2>1.0.7</h2>
<li>

    Added support for the WebContent calendar extension
<li>
    Added signing to the gbase.dll
    <h2>1.0.6</h2>
<li>
    Added support for sortoder, futurevents, singleevents on the calendarquery
<li>
    Added a ResponseString property on the GDataRequestException to make debugging 
    server side errors easier
<li>
    Fixed an issue with the GoogleBaseService, if you did set the RequestFactory 
    property twice, you would create too many header entries, and hence end up with 
    request denied responses
<li>
    Added the shipping attribute for GoogleBase
<li>
    Changed the payment attribute to payment_accepted for GoogleBase
    <h2>1.0.5</h2>
<li>
    Added batch support for GoogleFeeds, the first property to support this is the 
    GoogleBase product
<li>
    Added a unittest for GoogleBase. This code shows update/insert/delete against 
    base for single entries and batch entries refer to clients/cs/src/unittests/gbase.cs 
    for sample code.
<li>
    Added IComparable to atomuri.cs (based on a feature request on our issue list)
<li>
    GDataAuthRequestFactory is now a subclass of GDataRequestFactory
<li>
    Moved GCookies from GDataAuthRequestFactory to GDataRequestFactory and renamed 
    it to Cookies
<li>
    removed the debug binaries from the lib directory
<li>
    added a GoogleBase sample application in VB !
<li>
    added the build executables to the lib directory

    Fixed a .NET 2.0 issue in calendarservice.cs, that dropped connections during 
    repeated calls.
<li>
    Made the execution path more robust.
<li>
    Added a property, numberOfRetries on the GAuthRequestFactory to indicate how 
    often an Execution should be retried if the server returns an error.
<li>
    Fixed a bug in the daterange query creation (the +sign for the timezone was not 
    escaped properly)
<li>
    Fixed an issue with updating, where if you used the same AtomEntry/EventEntry 
    several times to update, it could happen that extension elements were doubled, 
    and the update failed.
<li>
    Fixed a bug in the parsing of all elements. This could cause an endless loop 
    when the content was empty.
<li>
    Fixed several content creation issues (issues 5-9 on the issue list)
<li>
    added support for the gd:extendedProperty
<li>

    Fixed the namespace creation for extensions, the wireformat should no longer 
    create the namespace declaration when it's not required
<li>
    Fixed the reminder persistence code
<li>
    added a TimeZone property on the EventFeed to retrieve the timezone value
<li>
    added a FindEvent method on the EventFeed. This one takes an OriginalEvent 
    object, and returns the Event that this is based on. This will go to the server 
    if required.
<li>
    Fixed recurrance issues in the extensions
<li>
    Moved EventFeed and EventEntry from the Google.GData.Extensions namespace to the 
    Google.GData.Calendar namespace
